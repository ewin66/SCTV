
I'm trying to use libvlcnet to playback a video and display audio visualizations too. For this reason, I added the following command line parameters:
--audio-visual=visual
--effect-list=scope

no matter what the effect-list is, "visual" will always cause the application to crash with a win32 exception that is impossible to catch, while "goom" just works fine, with the goom output overlayed on the normal video output.
If I run VLC from dos prompt using the exact same command line parameters, it works fine with both visual and goom, always displaying the audio visualization in a separate window.

I assume that when I run VLC from my C# application using libvlcnet, it "tries" to fit both the video output and the audio visualization output on the same picture box, i.e. not in a separate window. Is there any way to change this behaviour in order to get the audio visualization output on another windows or picture box?
