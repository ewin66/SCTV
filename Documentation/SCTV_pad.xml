SCTV is compatible with many optional accessories including remote controls, wireless mouse and keyboard, custom sound systems, etc.</Char_Desc_450>
      <Char_Desc_2000>The media library displays a categorized list of all available media files.  As you highlight the media files you will be able to see data specific to that file, things like description, ratings,  reviews and odd facts taken from the IMDB data base.  I would also like to add user ratings and comments and the ability to password protect media files, so only those who should be viewing a movie can.
The media library can be pointed to any number of local and network locations to find and display available media.  It will automatically watch and update itself when new files are added to these locations.
The media player plays our media files and displays information about the currently running file.  As the file is playing you are able to control all playback functions as well as view current position in the file and view the next queued media file.  You will be able to view information about current media including a description, ratings,  reviews and odd facts taken from the IMDB data base.</Char_Desc_2000>
