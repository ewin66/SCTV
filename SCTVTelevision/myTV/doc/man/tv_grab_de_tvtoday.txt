NAME
    tv_grab_de_tvtoday - Grab TV listings for Germany (from www.tvtoday.de
    webpage).

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_de_tvtoday --help

    tv_grab_de_tvtoday [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_de_tvtoday [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N]
    [--offset N] [--quiet] [--slow] [--nosqueezeout]

    tv_grab_de_tvtoday --list-channels

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Germany. The data
    comes from www.tvtoday.de which is the webpage of one of the most
    popular TV magazines in Germany. The grabber relies on parsing HTML so
    it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_de_tvtoday --configure to choose, which channels you
    want to download. Then running tv_grab_de_tvtoday with no arguments will
    output listings in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Ask for each available channel whether to download and write
    the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_de_tvtoday.conf. This is the file written by
    --configure and read when grabbing.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N grab N days. The default is seven.

    --offset N start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today (= zero). Set to -1 to grab data beginning yesterday.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --slow enables long strategy run: tvtoday.de publishes only some (vital)
    information on the actual listing pages, the rest is shown in a separate
    popup window. If you'd like to parse the data from these popups as well,
    supply this flag. But consider that the grab process takes much longer
    when doing so, since many more web pages have to be retrieved.

    --nosqueezeout disables aggressive squeeze out of information field from
    the index pages. If specified, the program description from tvtoday.de
    is passed trough as data of the desc-tag, otherwise the data is parsed
    for information about actors, director, etc. and understood data gets
    returned in it's corresponding field.

    --list-channels write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --help print a help message and exit.
