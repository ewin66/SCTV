NAME
    tv_grab_no - Grab TV listings for Norway.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_no --help

    tv_grab_no [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_no [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N]
    [--quiet]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Norway. The data
    comes from fredag.dagbladet.no. The grabber relies on parsing HTML so it
    might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_no --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_no with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_no.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N grab N days. The default is as many as the source carries.

    --offset N start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --help print a help message and exit.
