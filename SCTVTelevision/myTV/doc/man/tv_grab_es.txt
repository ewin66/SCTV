SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_es --help

    tv_grab_es [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_es [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N]
    [--quiet]

    tv_grab_es --list-channels

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Spain. Now supports
    the terrestrial analog tv listings, which is the most common tv viewed
    in Spain that currently has no EPG information. I have plans to add
    Satelite listings (now the Spanish platforms are in a merger process
    between providers and also cable (the listings has to be grabbed from
    different sites)). The tv listings comes from www.elpais.es The grabber
    relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_es --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_es with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_es.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N grab N days. The default is 3.

    --offset N start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --help print a help message and exit.
