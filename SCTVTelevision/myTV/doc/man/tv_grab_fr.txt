NAME
    tv_grab_fr - Grab TV listings for France.

SYNOPSIS
    To configure: tv_grab_fr --configure [--config-file FILE] To grab
    listings: tv_grab_fr [--output FILE] [--quiet] Slower, detailed grab:
    tv_grab_fr --slow [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N] [--quiet]
    Help: tv_grab_fr --help

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in France (Hertzian,
    Cable/satellite, Canal+ Sat, TPS). The data comes from
    tf1.guidetele.com. The default is to grab as many days as possible from
    the current day onwards. By default the program description are not
    downloaded, so if you want description and ratings, you should active
    the --slow option.

    --configure Grab channels informations from the website and ask for
    channel type and names.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N grab N days starting from today, rather than as many as
    possible. Due to the website organization, the speed is exactly the
    same, whatever the number of days is until you activate the --slow
    option. So this option is ignored if --slow is not also given.

    --offset N start grabbing N days from today, rather than starting today.
    N may be negative. Due to the website organization, N cannot be inferior
    to -1. As with --days, this is only useful for limiting downloads in
    --slow mode.

    --slow Get additional information from the website, like program
    description, reviews and credits.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --help print a help message and exit.
