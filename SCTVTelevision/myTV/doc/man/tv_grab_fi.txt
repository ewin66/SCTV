NAME
    tv_grab_fi - Grab TV listings for Finland.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_fi --help

    tv_grab_fi [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_fi [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N]
    [--quiet]

    tv_grab_fi --list-channels

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Finland. The data
    comes from www.katso.fi which is owned by one of the largest companies
    providing TV listings in Finland. The grabber relies on parsing HTML so
    it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_fi --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_fi with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_fi.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N grab N days. The default is ten.

    --offset N start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --list-channels write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --help print a help message and exit.

BUGS
    The data source does not include full channels information and the
    channels are identified by short names rather than the RFC2838 form
    recommended by the XMLTV DTD.
