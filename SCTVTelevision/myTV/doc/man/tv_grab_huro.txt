SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_huro --help

    tv_grab_huro [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_huro [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset

    tv_grab_huro --list-channels --loc [hu | ro]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Hungary or Romania.
    The grabber relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_huro --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_huro with no arguments will output
    listings in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_huro.conf. This is the file written by --configure
    and read when grabbing.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N grab N days. The default is eight.

    --offset N start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --list-channels write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --help print a help message and exit.

BUGS
    The data source does not include full channels information and the
    channels are identified by short names rather than the RFC2838 form
    recommended by the XMLTV DTD.
