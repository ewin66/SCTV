NAME
    tv_grab_it - Grab TV listings for Italy.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_it --help

    tv_grab_it [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_it [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N]
    [--quiet] [--slow]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Italy. The data
    comes from guidatv.libero.it (subpage of an italian portal). The grabber
    relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_it --configure to choose which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_it with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_it.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N grab N days. The default is 7.

    --offset N start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --slow downloads more details (descriptions, actors...). This means
    downloading a new file for each programme, so it's off by default to
    save time.

    --help print a help message and exit.

BUGS
    'Actors' are not always actors. Due to the way the site is made, we
    cannot tell actors from show hosts and the like.

    The data source does not include full channels information and the
    channels are identified by short names rather than the RFC2838 form
    recommended by the XMLTV DTD.
