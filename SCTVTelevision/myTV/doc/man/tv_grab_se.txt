DESCRIPTION
    Output TV and listings in XMLTV format for many stations available in
    Sweden. The data comes from the website of each respective TV-station.

    First you must run tv_grab_se --configure to choose which stations you
    want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_se with no arguments will get a listings for the
    stations you chose for five days including today.

    --configure Prompt for which stations to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_se.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than 5.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days. N may be negative.

    --quiet suppress the progress-bar normally shown on standard error.

    --debug provide more information on progress to stderr to help in
    debugging.

    --help print a help message and exit.

ERROR HANDLING
    If the grabber fails to download data for some channel on a specific
    day, it will print an errormessage to STDERR and then continue with the
    other channels and days. The grabber will exit with a status code of 1
    to indicate that the data is incomplete.

BUGS
    The grabber for Viasat (TV3, TV8 and ZTV) does not fetch any desriptions
    for the programmes, since it would then have to fetch one html-page per
    programme. It does however store a url for each programme where the
    description can be found.
