NAME
    tv_grab_uk_rt - Grab TV listings for the United Kingdom, from an
    alternative source.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_uk_rt --help

    tv_grab_uk_rt [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_uk_rt [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--quiet] [--days N]
    [--offset N] [--slow [--limit-details HH:MM-HH:MM] --get-categories]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV and radio listings in XMLTV format for many stations available
    in Britain. The data comes from the Radio Times website.

USAGE
    First you must run tv_grab_uk_rt --configure to choose which stations
    you want to receive. Then running tv_grab_uk_rt with no arguments will
    get about a fortnight's listings for the stations you chose.

    --configure Prompt for which stations to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_uk_rt.conf. This is the file written by --configure
    and read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than as many as possible.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N. N may be negative.

    --slow Fetch additional details for each programme. This requires one
    extra web page fetch per programme, so use with care.

    --limit-details HH:MM-HH:MM (use with --slow) Limit the additional
    details fetched for programmes by checking that the start time falls
    within the specified time range, which must be specified in 24-hour
    clock, eg: 16:00-02:00. This can significantly reduce the number of web
    page fetches.

    --get-categories (use with --slow) Attempt to find out the category each
    program is in. This requires another web page get per category per day,
    so it can really slow down the grab.

    --quiet suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --help print a help message and exit.

BUGS
    The website parsing isn't perfect and there will often be warning
    messages about bits of HTML that aren't understood. Some of the details
    provided by the site have to be thrown away because they cannot be
    accommodated in the XMLTV format; again, warning messages are printed.

    Rather than the all-or-nothing --slow mode, it would be better to fetch
    the details only for those programmes that are interesting, in some kind
    of two-pass grabbing.

    There is code to find out the 'categories' given for each programme, but
    that involves even more page fetches so it is disabled at present.
